#MyMusicApp
This app is a music web app intended for users to download latest music and also play demo. It has a simple landing page built on html, css, bootstrap and a bit interactive with the inclusion of some lines of javascript, users can play the demo songs available on the website. The project is not fully built as its just another test of my learning process. Opened for improvement.
